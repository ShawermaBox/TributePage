        <h3>Radiohead</h3>
        <p id="tribute-info">
          Radiohead are an English rock band formed in Abingdon, Oxfordshire, in 1985. The band
          consists of Thom Yorke (vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards), brothers Jonny Greenwood (lead
          guitar, keyboards, other instruments) and Colin Greenwood (bass), Ed O'Brien (guitar,
          backing vocals) and Philip Selway (drums, percussion). They have worked with producer
          Nigel Godrich and cover artist Stanley Donwood since 1994. Radiohead's experimental
          approach is credited with advancing the sound of alternative rock.
        </p>
        <p>
          After signing to EMI in 1991, Radiohead released their debut single "Creep" in 1992. It
          became a worldwide hit after the release of their debut album, Pablo Honey (1993). Their
          popularity and critical standing rose in the UK with the release of their second album,
          The Bends (1995). Radiohead's third album, OK Computer (1997), brought them international
          fame; noted for its complex production and themes of modern alienation, it is acclaimed as
          a landmark record of the Generation X era. Kid A (2000) marked a dramatic change in style,
          incorporating influences from electronic music, jazz, classical music and krautrock.
          Though Kid A divided listeners, it later attracted wide acclaim. It was followed by
          Amnesiac (2001), recorded in the same sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hail to the Thief (2003), with lyrics inspired by the War on Terror, was Radiohead's final
          album for EMI. Their subsequent releases have pioneered alternative release platforms such
          as pay-what-you-want and BitTorrent; Radiohead self-released their seventh album, In
          Rainbows (2007), as a download for which customers could set their own price, to critical
          and chart success. Their eighth album, The King of Limbs (2011), an exploration of rhythm,
          was developed using extensive looping and sampling. A Moon Shaped Pool (2016) prominently
          featured Jonny Greenwood's orchestral arrangements. Yorke, Jonny Greenwood, Selway, and
          O'Brien have released solo albums.
        </p>
        <p>
          As of 2011, Radiohead have sold more than 30 million albums worldwide. Their awards
          include six Grammy Awards and four Ivor Novello Awards. They have achieved seven top 10
          hits on the UK Singles Chart: "Creep" (1992), "Street Spirit (Fade Out)" (1996), "Paranoid
          Android" (1997), "Karma Police" (1998), "No Surprises" (1998), "Pyramid Song" (2001) and
          "There There" (2003). They have also achieved two top 40 hits on the US Billboard Hot 100.
          Rolling Stone named Radiohead one of the 100 greatest artists of all time, and Rolling
          Stone readers voted them the second-best artist of the 2000s. Five Radiohead albums have
          been included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time lists, and the band are
          the most nominated act in Mercury Prize history, with five nominations. They were inducted
          into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.

        <section id="thom-yorke">
          <h3>Thom Yorke</h3>
          <p>
            Thomas Edward Yorke (born 7 October 1968) is an English musician and the main vocalist
            and songwriter of the rock band Radiohead. A multi-instrumentalist, he mainly plays
            guitar and keyboards, and is known for his falsetto.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yorke was born in Northamptonshire. His family lived in Scotland before settling in
            Oxfordshire, England, where he formed Radiohead with his schoolmates. After he graduated
            from the University of Exeter, Radiohead signed to Parlophone; their early hit "Creep"
            made Yorke a celebrity, and Radiohead have gone on to achieve critical acclaim and sales
            of over 30 million albums. Yorke's early influences included alternative rock acts such
            as the Pixies and R.E.M.; Radiohead's fourth album, Kid A (2000), saw Yorke and the band
            move into electronic music, influenced by Warp acts such as Aphex Twin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yorke's solo work comprises mainly electronic music. His debut solo album, The Eraser,
            was released in 2006. To perform it live, in 2009 he formed a new band, Atoms for Peace,
            with musicians including Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and Radiohead producer Nigel
            Godrich; they released an album, Amok, in 2013. Yorke's second solo album, Tomorrow's
            Modern Boxes, was released in 2014, followed by Anima in 2019. He has collaborated with
            artists including PJ Harvey, Björk, Flying Lotus, and Modeselektor, and has composed for
            film and theatre; his first feature film soundtrack, Suspiria, was released in October
            2018. With artist Stanley Donwood, Yorke creates artwork for Radiohead albums. He often
            incorporates "erratic" dancing into his performances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yorke is an activist on behalf of human rights, animal rights, environmental and
            anti-war causes, and his lyrics incorporate political themes. He has been critical of
            the music industry, particularly of major labels and streaming services such as Spotify.
            With Radiohead and his solo work he has pioneered alternative music release platforms
            such as pay-what-you-want and BitTorrent. Along with the other members of Radiohead, he
            was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.

          <h3>Jonny Greenwood</h3>
          <p>
            Jonathan Richard Guy Greenwood (born 5 November 1971) is an English musician and
            composer. He is the lead guitarist and keyboardist of the alternative rock band
            Radiohead, and has written a number of film scores.
          </p>
          <p>
            Along with his elder brother, Radiohead bassist Colin, Greenwood attended Abingdon
            School in Abingdon near Oxford, England, where he met the future band members. The
            youngest of the group, Greenwood was the last to join, first playing keyboards and
            harmonica but soon becoming lead guitarist. He abandoned a degree in music when the band
            signed to Parlophone; their debut single "Creep" was distinguished by Greenwood's
            aggressive guitar work. Radiohead have since achieved critical acclaim and sold over 30
            million albums. Along with the other members of Radiohead, Greenwood was inducted into
            the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
            Greenwood has been named one of the greatest guitarists of all time by publications
            including Rolling Stone.[1][2][3] A multi-instrumentalist, Greenwood has also played
            instruments including bass guitar, piano, viola, and drums. He is a prominent player of
            the ondes Martenot, an early electronic instrument. He uses electronic techniques such
            as programming, sampling and looping, and writes music software used by Radiohead. He
            described his role in the band as an arranger, helping to transform Thom Yorke's demos
            into finished songs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Radiohead albums feature Greenwood's string and brass arrangements, and he has composed
            for orchestras including the London Contemporary Orchestra and the BBC Concert
            Orchestra. His first solo work, the soundtrack for the film Bodysong, was released in
            2003. In 2007, he scored There Will Be Blood, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, and has
            composed the soundtrack for every Anderson film since; in 2018, he was nominated for an
            Academy Award for his score for Anderson's Phantom Thread. Greenwood's other scores
            include two collaborations with director Lynne Ramsay. He has collaborated several times
            with the Israeli composer Shye Ben Tzur, including on the 2015 album Junun.

          <h3>Colin Greenwood</h3>
          <p>
            Colin Charles Greenwood (born 26 June 1969) is an English musician and the bassist for
            the alternative rock band Radiohead. Along with his younger brother, Radiohead guitarist
            Jonny Greenwood, Greenwood attended Abingdon School in Oxford, England, where he met the
            future band members. Radiohead have since achieved critical acclaim and have sold over
            30 million albums. Along with bass guitar, Greenwood plays upright bass and electronic
            instruments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Greenwood, whose father served in the British army, lived in Germany as a child for
            enough time to become fluent in German. He is the older brother of Radiohead guitarist
            Jonny Greenwood. The family historically had ties to the British Communist Party and the
            Fabian Society. Greenwood credited his older sister, Susan, with influencing his and his
            brother Jonny's taste in music as an adolescent: "She’s responsible for our precocious
            love of miserable music. The Fall, Magazine, Joy Division. We were ostracised at school
            because everyone else was into Iron Maiden."

          <h3>Ed O'Brien</h3>
          <p>
            Edward John O'Brien (born 15 April 1968) is an English guitarist and member of the rock
            band Radiohead. O'Brien attended Abingdon School in Oxfordshire, England, where he met
            the other members of Radiohead. O'Brien makes extensive use of effects units to create
            atmospheric sounds and textures, and provides backing vocals. His first solo album,
            Earth, was released in 2020, under the name EOB. In 2010, Rolling Stone named O'Brien
            the 59th greatest guitarist of all time. Along with the other members of Radiohead, he
            was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2019.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a child, O'Brien enjoyed cricket and theatre. His parents split when he was 10;
            O'Brien said "I think that's when music became my refuge". He grew up listening to
            post-punk acts such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Adam and the Ants, Depeche Mode, the
            Police and David Bowie. He said: "It was a very foetal [time] for music because people
            who went to art college or artists, or musicians, suddenly thought, 'Oh, I can be
            that'."
          </p>
          <p>
            The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, an independent school for
            boys in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. While O'Brien was playing Lysander in a school production
            of A Midsummer Night's Dream, he met future Radiohead singer Thom Yorke, who was scoring
            the production. Yorke asked him to join him for a jam. According to O'Brien, "Before
            that, [life] was a bit confusing, a bit crap. And then suddenly ... I felt something
            very strong, almost like some kind of epiphany, almost like: 'This is it.'"

            of English rock group Radiohead. In addition to drums, he provides backing vocals,
            synthesisers, along with occasional guitar and lead vocals, for 7 Worlds Collide. Selway

            In 1991, On a Friday signed a six-album recording contract with EMI and changed their
            name to Radiohead. They found early success with their 1992 single "Creep". Their third
            album, OK Computer (1997), propelled them to international fame and is often acclaimed
